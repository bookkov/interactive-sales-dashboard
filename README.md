# "Superstore" Sales Analysis Dashboard

## Project Description
This project is an interactive dashboard created in Google Sheets for sales data analysis. The goal of this project is to demonstrate skills in data handling, processing, visualization, and the creation of interactive reports.

## Tools Used
* Google Sheets:
    * Pivot Tables for data aggregation.
    * Charts and graphs for visualization.
    * Slicers for interactivity.
    * Formulas to calculate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

## Workflow
1.  Data Loading and Preparation: The raw data was loaded into Google Sheets.
2.  Aggregation: Key metrics were calculated using Pivot Tables, including: sales volume by region, category, customer segment, and monthly trends.
3.  Visualization: Based on the pivot tables, 5 key charts were built for a clear presentation of the data.
4.  Interactivity: Slicers were added to allow real-time filtering of all dashboard data by region and product category.
5.  Design: All elements were assembled on a single sheet, with the technical calculations hidden to create a clean and intuitive user interface.
